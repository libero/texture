/**
 * A component that renders an editor in an overlay when the selection is on the annotation.
 * In contrast to most annotations, which are just toggled on/off, there are specific annotions
 * which have data attached that has to be edited in a popover, e.g. external links.
 * Note: this is experimental. I want to move away from popups driven by commands and tools.
 * On one hand, these commands were always kind of a extra overhead, without any effect other than
 * to determine if the tool should be displayed or not.
 * Furthermore, our need for more complex editors for such popover was increasing (keywords editor, inline-cell editor, etc.)

      // and not use the element. In case of Undo however, there is no selection rectangle
